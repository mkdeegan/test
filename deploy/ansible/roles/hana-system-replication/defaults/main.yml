# Typical usage of this role requires that defaults defined in this role may be overridden. For example:
#
#  - role: hana-system-replication
#    vars:
#      sid: "D0T"
#      instance_number: "10"


# These defaults are commonly overridden by the user
sid: "HN1"
instance_number: "00"
hana_system_user_password: "Manager1"
hana_replication_mode: "sync"
hana_operation_mode: "logreplay"
hana_1_hsr_user: "hdbhasync"
hana_1_hsr_password: "HSRpassw0rd"

# For low spec Dev instances the timeout needs to be high
# A delay of 2 seconds is also recommended
# 2700 seconds is 45 minutes!
# May be overridden, if required
hana_stop_start_timeout_in_seconds: 2700
hana_stop_start_delay_in_seconds: 2
